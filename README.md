My research question is what is the relationship between the number ofnon profit homeless services and available beds for
shelter and the number of homeless people by state. I will make a data visualization to show different variables (number of 
nonprofits in the state related to homelessness or the number of shelter beds available) for each state to be able to visualize the 
relationship. My hypothesis is that the states with more adequate resources have decreased number of homeless people as 
compared to states will less nonprofits related to homelessness and less shelter beds.
